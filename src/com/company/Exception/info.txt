Throwable - basic class

It has two children:  Error and Exception

The Error class describes internal errors in the Java runtime environment

Exceptions are inherited from the Exception class

RuntimeException is the base class for the unchecked exceptions. The compiler does not
check the fact that such exceptions are processed and it is possible not to specify them
together with the throws operator in the method declaration. FOR EXAMPLE:
    ArithmeticException(dividing by 0)
    IndexOutOfBoundException
    IllegalArgumentException
    NullPointerException
    NumberFormatException

All other Exception's children are called verifiable exceptions. FOR EXAMPLE:
    CloneNotSupportedException - the class for whose object cloning is called does
                                 not implement the Cloneable interface
    InterruptedException - the stream is interrupted by another stream
    ClassNotFoundException - the class cannot be found

The getMessage() method returns an exception message
The getStackTrace() method returns an array containing the stack trace of the exception
The printStackTrace() method displays the stack trace
